## Core Idea and Keyboard Zones

Ghostboard is a conceptual keyboard layout offering an enhanced secure input mode to protect users from keyloggers, screen recording, and AI-driven touch analysis.

The keyboard is divided into two zones:
- **Numeric Zone:** Top row with numbers (0–9) and a few additional symbols.
- **Alphabet Zone:** Main block with letters (a–z).

## How Secure Mode Works

The user manually activates secure mode.

Upon activation, all letters and numbers are randomly shuffled within their respective zones.

### Two working modes (user-defined):

1. **Pro Mode (maximum security):**
   - After each keystroke, all keys in the same zone (letters or numbers) are reshuffled.

2. **Simple Mode (moderate security):**
   - After each keystroke, only the pressed key is swapped with a random key from its zone.

## Future Enhancements

- Security fonts to counter AI text recognition.
- Emoji-based digits (e.g. ☝️ = 1, ✌️ = 2) to hinder screen pattern tracking.

## Protection Against Threats

| Threat                      | Protection Mechanism                                                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Keyloggers**             | Constant reshuffling makes key logs useless.                                               |
| **Screen Recording**       | Visual input becomes unpredictable and hard to track.                                     |
| **AI Touch Analysis**      | No stable typing patterns — AI training and detection become ineffective.                 |
