## Core Idea and Keyboard Zones

Ghostboard is a conceptual keyboard layout offering an enhanced secure input mode to protect users from keyloggers, screen recording, and AI-driven touch analysis.

The keyboard is divided into two zones:
- **Numeric Zone:** Top row with numbers (0–9) and a few additional symbols.
- **Alphabet Zone:** Main block with letters (a–z).

Ghostboard can be used on:
- Devices with touchscreens (phones, tablets)
- Devices with mouse input (e.g., terminals, ATMs, kiosks)

## How Secure Mode Works

The user manually activates secure mode.

Upon activation, all letters and numbers are randomly shuffled within their respective zones.

### Two working modes (user-defined):

1. **Pro Mode (maximum security):**
   - After each keystroke, all keys in the same zone (letters or numbers) are reshuffled.

2. **Simple Mode (moderate security):**
   - After each keystroke, only the pressed key is swapped with a random key from its zone.

## Future Enhancements

- Security fonts and visual distortions to counter AI recognition.
- Emoji-based digits (e.g. ☝️ = 1, ✌️ = 2) to make screen tracking harder.
- Confusion mode: visual decoys and animated distractions.
- Multi-layout support: switch between 5 of the most used global languages with a single button.
- One-tap mode switch (Pro / Simple).
- Compatibility with devices using mouse input.
- Full zone customization and visual skinning.
- Licensing options for banking, public kiosks, and government use.
- And more: from conceptual ideas to commercial strategies.

## Protection Against Threats

| Threat               | Protection Mechanism                                                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Keyloggers**       | Constant reshuffling makes key logs useless.                                |
| **Screen Recording** | Visual input becomes unpredictable and hard to track.                       |
| **AI Touch Analysis**| No stable typing patterns — AI training and detection become ineffective.   |

## Compatible Devices

- Android / iOS smartphones
- Tablets
- Touchscreen-based terminals (banking, security)
- Desktop systems using on-screen input with a mouse
